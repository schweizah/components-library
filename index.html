    <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Clarkson Club Television (CCTv) is the main broadcasting hub for all Clarkson University sports. 
      While hockey events are our main broadcast, we have also broadcasted soccer, volleyball, swimming, basketball, lacrosse, 
      baseball, and softball. In addition to athletics, we also stream on campus happenings at Clarkson such as: graduation events, 
      recognition events, robotics tournaments, and TED talks. We teach students live broadcasting skills and give them opportunities 
      to gain professional experience. Our club is essential for parents, alumni, and prospective students to view sports and 
      events on campus. </p>
      
      <p>CCTv additionally plans to expand from purely live broadcasting to also include video production to our
      organization. With the addition of video production, we plan to create promotional content for
      events around Clarkson University. During live broadcasts, this promotional content will be played to
      our viewers on ESPN+ and Stretch Internet. CCTv also plans to acquire a new studio space in Cheel.
      With this new space we will be able to have a space where we can record interviews with athletes
      and other personnel on campus for our promotional content. We hope that our organization as
      whole can continue to be a valuable media asset to the Clarkson University campus." </p>
